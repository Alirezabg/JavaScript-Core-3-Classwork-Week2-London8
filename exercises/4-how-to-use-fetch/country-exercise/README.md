# Exercise 1

In groups the students should create a page of details about the United Kingdom.

The API endpoint can be found [here](https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/Great%20Britain?fullText=true)

The website should include

- The name of the country
- The country's capital city
- An unordered list of the country's name in other all of the other returned languages

## Steps

Example `html` and `javascript` files can be found in this folder

1. Create a `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` file to hold different types of code
2. In your `HTML` file, write a simple basis for your website (e.g. [this](https://www.sitepoint.com/a-basic-html5-template/))
   - Make sure all of your `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` files are linked together!
3. Write a function using fetch that retrieves the `JSON` from the _Country API_
   - To make sure it's working print the JSON to the console using `console.log()`
4. Create a `h1` tag on the website using DOM manipulation and add the country's name inside it
5. Create a `h2` tag on the website using DOM manipulation and add the capital city's name inside it
6. Create a `ul` tag on the website using DOM manipulation
   - For each of the translated names in the JSON, add a `li` tag
7. Uncomment the lines inside `onLoad()` to load other countries details!

## Extra

- Load the country's flag into an `img` tag
- Add CSS to make your website look really nice
- Add other information from the JSON to your Country Details
